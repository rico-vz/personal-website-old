# Personal Website (Outdated)

My old (2020 - 2021) personal website / portfolio website. Created using HTML + TailwindCSS.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rico-vz/personal-website-old
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd personal-website-old
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI build process

You can now view the website using ./public/index.html & ./public/portfolio.html
